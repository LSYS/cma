  abstract  = "Causal inference is a complex scientific task that relies on
               evidence from multiple sources and a variety of methodological
               approaches. By providing a cohesive presentation of concepts and
               methods that are currently scattered across journals in several
               disciplines, Causal Inference: What If provides an introduction
               to causal inference for scientists who design studies and
               analyze data. The book is divided into three parts of increasing
               difficulty: causal inference without models, causal inference
               with models, and causal inference from complex longitudinal
               data.FEATURES: - Emphasizes taking the causal question seriously
               enough to articulate it with sufficient precision - Shows that
               causal inference from observational data relies on
               subject-matter knowledge and therefore cannot be reduced to a
               collection of recipes for data analysis - Describes causal
               diagrams, both directed acyclic graphs and single-world
               intervention graphs - Explains various data analysis approaches
               to estimate causal effects from individual-level data, including
               the g-formula, inverse probability weighting, g-estimation,
               instrumental variable estimation, outcome regression, and
               propensity score adjustment - Includes software and real data
               examples, as well as 'Fine Points' and 'Technical Points'
               throughout to elaborate on certain key topicsCausal Inference:
               What If has been written for all scientists that make causal
               inferences, including epidemiologists, statisticians,
               psychologists, economists, sociologists, political scientists,
               computer scientists, and more. The book is substantially
               class-tested, as it has been used in dozens of universities to
               teach courses on causal inference at graduate and advanced
               undergraduate level.",

  abstract = "Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis
              has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the
              framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and
              demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a
              general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a
              particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key
              identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the
              framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an
              alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our
              approach is general because it offers the definition,
              identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal
              mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical
              model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements
              closely together within a single framework. As a result, the
              proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear
              relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous
              and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables.
              The general definition and identification result also allow us to
              develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used
              models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the
              robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the
              key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the
              Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software
              that implements all our proposed methods.",

               exposure from effects relayed through an intermediate variable
               (indirect effects). We show that adjustment for the intermediate
               variable, which is the most common method of estimating direct
               effects, can be biased. We also show that, even in a randomized
               crossover trial of exposure, direct and indirect effects cannot
               be separated without special assumptions; in other words, direct
               and indirect effects are not separately identifiable when only
               exposure is randomized. If the exposure and intermediate never
               interact to cause disease and if intermediate effects can be
               controlled, that is, blocked by a suitable intervention, then a
               trial randomizing both exposure and the intervention can
               separate direct from indirect effects. Nonetheless, the
               estimation must be carried out using the G-computation
               algorithm. Conventional adjustment methods remain biased. When
               exposure and the intermediate interact to cause disease, direct
               and indirect effects will not be separable even in a trial in
               which both the exposure and the intervention blocking
               intermediate effects are randomly assigned. Nonetheless, in such
               a trial, one can still estimate the fraction of exposure-induced
               disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate.
               Even in the absence of an intervention blocking the intermediate
               effect, the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be
               prevented by control of the intermediate can be estimated with

               presents a new way of defining the effect transmitted through a

              led to theoretical and methodological advancements---effect
              definitions with causal interpretation, clarification of
              assumptions required for effect identification, and an expanding
              array of options for effect estimation. However, the literature
              on these results is fast-growing and complex, which may be
              confusing to researchers unfamiliar with causal inference or
              unfamiliar with mediation. The goal of this article is to help
              ease the understanding and adoption of causal mediation analysis.
              It starts by highlighting a key difference between the causal
              inference and traditional approaches to mediation analysis and
              making a case for the need for explicit causal thinking and the
              causal inference approach in mediation analysis. It then explains
              in as-plain-as-possible language existing effect types, paying
              special attention to motivating these effects with different
              types of research questions, and using concrete examples for
              illustration. This presentation differentiates 2 perspectives (or
              purposes of analysis): the explanatory perspective (aiming to
              explain the total effect) and the interventional perspective
              (asking questions about hypothetical interventions on the
              exposure and mediator, or hypothetically modified exposures). For
              the latter perspective, the article proposes tapping into a
              general class of interventional effects that contains as special
              cases most of the usual effect types---interventional direct and
              indirect effects, controlled direct effects and also a
              generalized interventional direct effect type, as well as the
              total effect and overall effect. This general class allows
              flexible effect definitions which better match many research
              questions than the standard interventional direct and indirect
              effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights

                conducting a process analysis in evaluation research. Such an
                analysis attempts to identify the process that mediates the
                effects of some treatment, by estimating the parameters of a
                causal chain between the treatment and some outcome variable.
                Two different procedures for estimating mediation are discussed.
                In addition we present procedures for examining whether a
                treatment exerts its effects, in part, by altering the mediating
                process that produces the outcome. Finally, the benefits of
                process analysis in evaluation research are underlined.",

  abstract  = "[We outline a framework for causal inference in settings where
               assignment to a binary treatment is ignorable, but compliance
               with the assignment is not perfect so that the receipt of
               treatment is nonignorable. To address the problems associated
               with comparing subjects by the ignorable assignment-an
               ``intention-to-treat analysis''-we make use of instrumental
               variables, which have long been used by economists in the
               context of regression models with constant treatment effects. We
               show that the instrumental variables (IV) estimand can be
               embedded within the Rubin Causal Model (RCM) and that under some
               simple and easily interpretable assumptions, the IV estimand is
               the average causal effect for a subgroup of units, the
               compliers. Without these assumptions, the IV estimand is simply
               the ratio of intention-to-treat causal estimands with no
               interpretation as an average causal effect. The advantages of
               embedding the IV approach in the RCM are that it clarifies the
               nature of critical assumptions needed for a causal
               interpretation, and moreover allows us to consider sensitivity
               of the results to deviations from key assumptions in a
               straightforward manner. We apply our analysis to estimate the
               effect of veteran status in the Vietnam era on mortality, using
               the lottery number that assigned priority for the draft as an
               instrument, and we use our results to investigate the
               sensitivity of the conclusions to critical assumptions.]",

              seekers demonstrated that the intervention facilitated

              active ingredients targeted by the intervention. Structural
              equation modeling analysis demonstrated that an enhanced sense of
              mastery had mediating effects on reemployment, financial strain,
              and reduction in depressive symptoms. Another active ingredient,
              inoculation against setbacks, was shown to protect those who
              suffered the setback of losing a job after temporarily regaining
              one. The inoculation protected them from experiencing the high
              level of depressive symptoms that was typical of their
              counterparts in the control group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
