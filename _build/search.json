Some funding agencies (e.g., NIH) for research grants even encourage or require mediation analyses of interventions to understand mechanisms (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021). “Mediation analyses” is also increasingly popular. FIGURE should sum up this statement of need.\nSince results from mediation analysis may influence policy and practice, I thought I should at least gain some scientific literacy on it. Here’s my dive into mediation analysis. Buckle up."

    "section": "Mediation through the lens of potential outcomes",
    "text": "Mediation through the lens of potential outcomes\nI was wondering how mediation analysis fit into this barebones potential outcomes framework. Most publications with mediation analysis are in the tradition of the Baron and Kenny tradition (Judd and Kenny 1981; Baron and Kenny 1986; MacKinnon 2012) (hereafter the classical mediation approach). Inherent in mediation analysis, whether made explicit or not, is a causal hypothesis (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021). T causes Y through M. There is, however, nothing in the classical approach that guarantees that uni-direction.33 A “mediation analysis” without this explicit path (partly implied by the temporal ordering) is really just a “third variable analysis” which is an analysis of association (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021).\nSo mediation could benefit from, or deserves, explicit causal thinking (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021).4 Work to think of mediation in the causal inference framework started as early as Robins and Greenland (1992) and as recent (at time of writing) as Stuart et al. (2022) (here after the causal inference approach).5 With a proposed mediation path through a variable \\(M\\), the analog of the ATE (from Equation 1) is now: 64 This is different from other regular regression analyses, where, depending on the target and asssumptions, both causal and conditional association interpretations are valid (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021).5 Separate issue of temporal ordering of T, M, and Y (not covered in this vignette. See P49 of Stuart et al 2021 for more references.)6 This PO notation is similar to that in Imbens (2004), Angrist and Pischke (2009), Kosuke Imai, Keele, and Tingley (2010); Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart (2021), etc. Pearl (2001), Hernan and Robins (2023), etc., have slightly different PO notations.\n\\[\n\\tau = \\E\\big[Y\\left(1, M(1)\\right)\\big] - \\E\\big[Y(0, M(0))\\big],\n\\tag{3}\\] where (like \\(T\\)) the simplest scenario is: \\[\nM = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if T = 1}, \\\\\n0 & \\text{if T = 0},\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where the value of the mediator \\(M\\) also depends on \\(T\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediation\n\n  \n\nM\n\n M   \n\nY\n\n Y   \n\nM-&gt;Y\n\n    \n\nT\n\n T   \n\nT-&gt;M\n\n    \n\nT-&gt;Y\n\n   \n\n\nFigure 2: Graph of mediation analysis. The path between T and Y is the direct effect (Equation 4). The mediation effect is captured from \\(T\\) to \\(M\\) and then \\(M\\) to \\(Y\\) (Equation 5).\n\n\n\nFrom the total effect (Equation 3),7 we can start decomposing into the direct and indirect effects.8 Apparently there are two different sets of estimands (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021). (No one told me that…)7 The total effect (TE) is apparently used in place of the ATE in the language of mediation analysis (e.g., Judd and Kenny 1981; Robins and Greenland 1992; K. Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010; Bullock, Green, and Ha 2010; Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021; Hernan and Robins 2023).8 While going through a bunch of resources different fields, I came across a suggestion that the direct effect should really be called the unmediated effect (although I was unable to trace back the source). The notion is that the direct effect is no more a direct effect than the residual is a guassian error. If there are unspecified mediation pathway(s), the direct effect will subsume those.\nThe direct effect is: \\[\n\\zeta(t) \\equiv \\E\\big[Y_i(1, M_i(t))\\big] - \\E\\big[Y_i(0, M_i(t))\\big], \\qquad t \\in \\{0, 1\\}.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nThe indirect effect is: \\[\n\\delta(t) \\equiv \\E\\big[Y_i(t, M_i(1))\\big] - \\E\\big[Y_i(t, M_i(0))\\big], \\qquad t \\in \\{0, 1\\}.\n\\tag{5}\\]\nVarying \\(t\\) gives two different sets of estimands for each of \\(\\delta\\) and \\(\\zeta\\)."

Another one is pure direct effect and total indirect effect (e.g., Robins and Greenland 1992; Hernan and Robins 2023).\nThis decomposition is suitable for strong priors about a direct effect but unclear priors on whether an indirect effect also exists.

We also only observe actualized potential outcomes \\(Y(t, m)\\) for the corresponding \\(m\\) and \\(t\\) values. From the AITE (Equation 7), the observed differences in a mediated effect, given that treatment is “switched on” \\(t=1\\), is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\E\\big[Y\\big|T=1, M = 1\\big] - \\E\\big[Y\\big|T=1, M=0\\big] \\\\\n&=\\E\\big[Y(1,1)\\big|T=1, M=1\\big] - \\E\\big[Y(1,0)\\big|T=1, M=0\\big] \\\\\n&=\\E\\big[Y(1,1)\\big|M=1\\big] - \\E\\big[Y(1,0)\\big|M=0\\big]  \\qquad\\qquad (\\text{from }Y_i(t,m) \\ind T_i)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nwhere, even given randomization of \\(T\\) (analagous to Equation 2 in the un-mediated case), the selection issue with \\(M\\) persists. It will carry its own selection bias unless additional assumptions are imposed.

The second equality collects terms into the underlying mediation effect and an additional bias component.1111 ?sec-bias-bounds-assumptions-algebra in the Supplementary appendix offer an alternative algebraic insight of the bias.\nThere is a tendency for the bias to be positive, and, therefore overstate the mediation effect. Take as concrete example, a case where we are interested in child income \\(Y\\), parent income \\(T\\), and college attendance \\(M\\) in a classic case of intergenerational income mobility. Parent income affects child income, but also potentially through access to better education. The first part of the bias is the counterfactual of the potential income of the child of not going to college, given that she did. Conditional on parent income, the child that goes to college should have qualities (non-existent in the child that never goes to college) that would be helpful for labor market success, and, to this extent, suggest that the bias component is \\(&gt; 0\\). Hence, without intervenening on the assignment of \\(M\\), the estimated mediation effect tends to be, but may still be useful to provide optimistic bounds for the underlying mediation effect.1212 This bound is not a statistical property but based on reasoning about what the plausible potential outcomes are from on domain understanding.\nThe last line in Equation 13 only reduces to the true AITE by imposing additional assumptions.\n\\[\n\\Big\\{ Y_i(t, m), M_i(t')\\Big\\} \\ind T_i\n\\tag{14}\\] \\[\n\\big[Y_i(t', m) \\ind M_i(t)\\big] \\Big| T_i = t\n\\tag{15}\\]\nFirst, for a causal interpretation, the treatment assignment \\(T\\) has to be statistically orthogonal to the potential outcomes and the potential mediators. This should usually be satisfied with randomization of \\(T\\) as in the usual unmediated case (Section 2). Second, given the actual value \\(T_i = t\\), the mediator \\(M\\) should be statistically orthogonal to the potential outcome. The proposed solution to achieve this is to subject \\(M\\) to experimental manipulation, just as with \\(T\\).13 The above is the sequential ignorability assumption since they are made sequentially (K. Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010).13 ?sec-heterogeneities in the Supplementary appendix shows an example of how the AITE cannot be identified even with randomization if heterogeneities in effects exist.\nIn addition, there is an (slighly more subtle) assumption with the common data support \\(T\\) (and \\(M\\)). \\[\n\\exists \\theta &gt; 0: \\ \\theta \\leq \\E \\left[ T_i = t \\right] \\leq (1-\\theta), \\qquad t \\in \\{0, 1\\}\n\\] With an additional modeling of mediation, an additional assumption applies to the mediator: \\[\n\\exists \\eta &gt; 0: \\ \\eta \\leq \\E \\left[ M_i = m \\big| T_i = t \\right] \\leq (1-\\eta), \\qquad t \\in \\{0, 1\\}.\n\\]\nLoosely speaking, with mediation, twice the identification assumptions are needed.\n\n\n\n\nAngrist, Joshua D, and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. 2009.
