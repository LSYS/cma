    "text": "Statement of need\nMediation analysis is not new (Judd and Kenny 1981). But it is to me. Mediation analysis aims to shed light on mechanisms between some exposure and some outcomes of interest. It’s an ambitious aim but, if well identified, has potential implementational and policy implications. Funding agencies (e.g., National Institute of Mental Health, NIH) for research grants encourage or even require mediation analyses of interventions to understand mechanisms (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021). “Mediation analysis” is also increasingly popular. Since it’s increasingly popular and results may influence policy and practice, I thought I should at least gain some literacy on mediation analysis. This vignette collects the gist of what I’ve managed to get from the literature. Figure 1 (taken directly from Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021) should sum up this statement of need.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The raw counts in the top panel are counts reported by Google Scholar on two searches for articles (excluding patents and citations) with “mediation analysis” in the title, and for those with the same phrase anywhere in the text; the adjusted counts are adjusted for the fact that the volume of all Google Scholar entries varies in size from year to year, using 2015 as the standard year.

    "section": "Mediation through the lens of potential outcomes",
    "text": "Mediation through the lens of potential outcomes\nI was wondering how mediation analysis fits into this barebones potential outcomes framework. Most publications with mediation analysis are in the Baron and Kenny tradition [Judd and Kenny (1981); Baron and Kenny (1986); MacKinnon (2012); hereafter, the classical mediation approach]. Inherent in mediation analysis, whether made explicit or not, is a causal hypothesis (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021). T causes Y through M. There is, however, nothing in the mechanics of the classical approach that guarantees that uni-direction.33 A “mediation analysis” without this explicit path (partly implied by the temporal ordering) is really just a “third variable analysis”, which is an analysis of association (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021).\nSo mediation could benefit from, or deserves, explicit causal thinking (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021).4 Work to think of mediation in the causal inference framework started as early as Robins and Greenland (1992) and as recent (at time of writing) as Stuart et al. (2022) (hereafter, the causal inference approach).5 With a proposed mediation path through a variable \\(M\\), the analog of the ATE (from Equation 1) is now: 64 This is different from other regular regression analyses, where, depending on the target and assumptions, both causal and conditional association interpretations are valid (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021).5 Separate issue of temporal ordering of T, M, and Y (not covered in this vignette. See P49 of Stuart et al 2021 for more references.)6 This PO notation is similar to that in Imbens (2004), Angrist and Pischke (2009), Kosuke Imai, Keele, and Tingley (2010); Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart (2021), etc. Pearl (2001), Hernan and Robins (2023), etc., have slightly different PO notations.\n\\[\n\\tau = \\E\\big[Y\\left(1, M(1)\\right)\\big] - \\E\\big[Y(0, M(0))\\big],\n\\tag{3}\\] where (like \\(T\\)) the simplest scenario is: \\[\nM = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if T = 1}, \\\\\n0 & \\text{if T = 0},\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where the value of the mediator \\(M\\) also depends on \\(T\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediation\n\n  \n\nM\n\n M   \n\nY\n\n Y   \n\nM-&gt;Y\n\n    \n\nT\n\n T   \n\nT-&gt;M\n\n    \n\nT-&gt;Y\n\n   \n\n\nFigure 3: Graph of mediation analysis. The path between T and Y is the direct effect (Equation 4). The mediation effect is captured from \\(T\\) to \\(M\\) and then \\(M\\) to \\(Y\\) (Equation 5).\n\n\n\nFrom the total effect (Equation 3),7 we can start decomposing into the direct and indirect effects.8 Apparently, there are two different sets of estimands (Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021). No one told me that…7 The total effect (TE) is used in place of the ATE in the language of mediation analysis (e.g., Judd and Kenny 1981; Robins and Greenland 1992; K. Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010; Bullock, Green, and Ha 2010; Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart 2021; Hernan and Robins 2023).8 While going through a bunch of resources from different fields, I came across a suggestion that the direct effect should really be called the unmediated effect (although I was unable to trace back the source). The notion is that the direct effect is no more a direct effect than the residual is a Gaussian error. If there are unspecified mediation pathway(s), the direct effect will subsume those.\nThe direct effect is: \\[\n\\zeta(t) \\equiv \\E\\big[Y_i(1, M_i(t))\\big] - \\E\\big[Y_i(0, M_i(t))\\big], \\; t \\in \\{0, 1\\}.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nThe indirect effect is: \\[\n\\delta(t) \\equiv \\E\\big[Y_i(t, M_i(1))\\big] - \\E\\big[Y_i(t, M_i(0))\\big], \\; t \\in \\{0, 1\\}.\n\\tag{5}\\]\nVarying \\(t\\) gives two different sets of estimands for each of \\(\\delta\\) and \\(\\zeta\\)."

The second equality collects terms into the underlying mediation estimand and an additional bias component.1111 Section 14.3 in the Supplementary appendix offers an alternative algebraic insight of the bias.\nThere is a tendency for this bias to be positive,12 and, therefore, overstate the mediation effect. Take, as a concrete example, a case where we are interested in child income \\(Y\\), parent income \\(T\\), and college attendance \\(M\\) in a classic case of intergenerational income mobility. Parent income affects child income, but also potentially through access to better education. The expected sign of the AITE should be positive. The first part of the bias is the counterfactual of the potential income of the child of not going to college, given that she did. Conditional on parent income, the child that goes to college should have qualities (non-existent in the child that never goes to college) that would be helpful for labor market success, and, to this extent, suggest that the bias component is \\(&gt; 0\\). Hence, without intervening in the assignment of \\(M\\), the estimated mediation effect tends to be biased. But the observed effect may still be useful to provide optimistic bounds for the underlying mediation effect.1312 Or, generally, share the same sign as the AITE.13 This bound is not a statistical property. Instead, the bound is based on counterfactual reasoning about what the plausible potential outcomes are from domain understanding.\nThe last line in Equation 14 only reduces to the true AITE by imposing additional assumptions.\n\\[\n\\Big\\{ Y_i(t, m), M_i(t')\\Big\\} \\ind T_i\n\\tag{15}\\] \\[\n\\big[Y_i(t', m) \\ind M_i(t)\\big] \\Big| T_i = t\n\\tag{16}\\]\nFirst, for a causal interpretation, the treatment assignment \\(T\\) has to be statistically orthogonal to the potential outcomes and the potential mediators. This should usually be satisfied with randomization of \\(T\\) as in the usual unmediated case (Section 2). This assumption was imposed in the last equality of Equation 13. Second, given the actual value \\(T_i = t\\), the mediator \\(M\\) should be statistically orthogonal to the potential outcome. The standard proposed solution to achieve this is to subject \\(M\\) to experimental manipulation, just as with \\(T\\).14 The above is the sequential ignorability assumption since the assumptions are made sequentially (K. Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010).14 Section 14.4 in the Supplementary appendix shows an example of how the AITE cannot be identified even with randomization if heterogeneities in effects exist.\nIn addition, there is a (slightly more subtle) assumption with the common data support for \\(T\\) (and \\(M\\)). \\[\n\\exists \\theta &gt; 0: \\ \\theta \\leq \\E \\left[ T_i = t \\right] \\leq (1-\\theta), \\qquad t \\in \\{0, 1\\}\n\\] With mediation, an additional assumption applies to the mediator: \\[\n\\exists \\eta &gt; 0: \\ \\eta \\leq \\E \\left[ M_i = m \\big| T_i = t \\right] \\leq (1-\\eta), \\qquad t \\in \\{0, 1\\}.\n\\]\nLoosely speaking, with mediation, twice the identification assumptions are needed."

Instead, the identification assumptions are those canonically established in the instrumental variable framework, such as that of exclusion restriction (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1996). Moreover, the instrumental variable framework by design a priori rules out other causal mechanisms. This may be less than ideal for many health and social science research (K. Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010)."

JOBS (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills training) II is a randomized field experiment. The goal was to identify the effects of a job training intervention on employment status and also on the mental wellbeing of the job seekers.1717 JOBS II had 1,801 participants randomized into treatment and control groups. The treatment group participated in job skills workshops that taught job search skills and coping mechanisms. I.e., they got the JOBS program. For mental wellbeing, the key outcome measure is a continuous measure of Depressive symptoms using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (subscale of 11 items).\nAn extension of this interest is also to understand mediator factors. Past studies found the program helpful in reducing depressive symptoms (Figure 7). If true, what would be a mediating factor? Credibly identifying mediator factor(s) has implications for future programs. Furthermore, would the mediating factor be moderated by treatment status? This would help identify high-risk subgroups that can be more effectively screened in future programs (Vinokur and Schul 1997).\nThe mediator that is evaluated is Job-search self-efficacy.18 Importantly, self-efficacy is not randomized, so the second ignorability assumption is not satisfied by design. Instead, baseline covariates measured before the workshops (e.g., education, income, race, marital status, age, sex, previous occupation, and the level of economic hardship) are adjusted for. It turns out that a mediation effect exists. The estimated mediation effect is negative, which implies that JOBS helped reduce depressive symptoms by increasing job-search self-efficacy. The direct effect and the total effects, however, have null estimated effects. Moderating the mediator also yields null estimated effects. Figure 8 summarizes the relationship.18 Self-efficacy comes from six (five-point scale) items on the degree of confidence in being able to successfully perform six essential job-search activities (e.g., completing job application/resume, using social network to discover promising job openings, getting point across in a job interview; Vinokur and Schul (1997)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\nT\n\nJOBS program   \n\nM\n\nJob-search   self-efficacy    \n\nT-&gt;M\n\n  +ve*   \n\nY\n\nDepressive symptoms   \n\nT-&gt;Y\n\n  -ve   \n\nM-&gt;Y\n\n  -ve*  \n\n\nFigure 8: Job-search self-efficacy as a mediating effect: Participants with higher self-efficacy report lower levels of depressive symptoms.

This vignette is merely my attempt at parsing and then synthesizing different resources that already exist (some as recent as Stuart et al. (2022) in the Journal of Causal Inference) to gain some literacy on (causal) mediation analysis. A lot of studies use mediation to imply some directional effect. This clearly alludes to a causal channel. Yet it’s rarely clear what the estimands are and what identification assumptions are needed. This tracks with the exegesis by Bullock, Green, and Ha (2010) and Nguyen, Schmid, and Stuart (2021). What’s covered here should make identification assumptions more transparent. If there’s some error you want to point out or have comments, feel free to reach out to me (lucas at lucasshen dot com). Also, not everything is covered here, but the list of canonical resources should lead to more details."

Starting with the linear structural equation model: \\[\\begin{align}\nY_i &= \\alpha_1 + \\beta_1 T_i + \\varepsilon_{1i}\\\\\nM_i &= \\alpha_2 + \\beta_2 T_i + \\varepsilon_{2i}\\\\\nY_i &= \\alpha_3 + \\beta_3 T_i + \\gamma M_i + \\varepsilon_{3i}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe probability limit of the estimated mediated effect \\(\\hat{\\gamma}\\) (Bullock, Green, and Ha 2010) is \\[\n\\underbrace{\\gamma}_{\\text{AITE}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{cov(\\varepsilon_{2i}, \\varepsilon_{3i})}{var(\\varepsilon_{2i})}}_{\\text{asymptotic bias}},\n\\] where \\(cov(\\varepsilon_{2i}, \\varepsilon_{3i})\\) is the covariance of the error terms in the un-mediated model and the mediated model. So \\(\\hat{\\gamma}\\) is only consistent if the covariance term reduces to 0, which is unlikely because whatever unmeasured \\(X_i\\) is in \\(\\varepsilon_{2i}\\) should also be present in \\(\\varepsilon_{3i}\\) (like unmeasured qualities of a good worker in Section 8). Moreover, the sign of \\(cov(\\varepsilon_{2i}, \\varepsilon_{3i})\\) tends to coincide with the sign of \\(\\gamma\\), leading to the overstatement of the magnitude of the mediation effect \\(\\gamma\\), if any (as discussed in Section 8).\n\n\n\nHeterogeneities in mediation effect\n\nNot as much, it seems, is said about heterogeneities in mediation analysis. Bullock, Green, and Ha (2010) do a treatment of this. Heterogeneities, together with the product-of-coefficients method, can be problematic even when \\(M\\) is already subject to experimental intervention.\nA similar model to Equation 10 and Equation 11 with heterogeneities in effect is \\[\\begin{align}\nM_i &= \\alpha_1 + \\beta_{1i} T_i + \\varepsilon_{1i}\\\\\nY_i &= \\alpha_2 + \\beta_{2i} T_i + \\gamma_{i} M_i + \\varepsilon_{2i}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroupA\n\n  \n\nM\n\n M   \n\nY\n\n Y   \n\nM-&gt;Y\n\n  2   \n\nT\n\n T   \n\nT-&gt;M\n\n  2   \n\nT-&gt;Y\n\n  (direct effect)  \n\n\nFigure 11: Group A’s indirect effect is \\(4 (= (2)(2))\\). The effect from \\(T\\) to \\(M\\) is 2, and the effect from \\(M\\) to \\(Y\\) is 2. Abstracting away from direct effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroupB\n\n  \n\nM\n\n M   \n\nY\n\n Y   \n\nM-&gt;Y\n\n  -1   \n\nT\n\n T   \n\nT-&gt;M\n\n   -3   \n\nT-&gt;Y\n\n  (direct effect)  \n\n\nFigure 12: Group B’s indirect effect is \\(3 (= (-3)(-1))\\). The effect from \\(T\\) to \\(M\\) is -3, and the effect from \\(M\\) to \\(Y\\) is -1. Abstracting away from direct effects.\n\n\n\nTo see why heterogeneity could be bad without simulations, suppose we know that the true effects for two groups, A and B (equal proportions), are as follow: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\beta_{1A} &= 2\\\\\n\\gamma_{A} &= 2\n\\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align}\n\\beta_{1B} &= -3\\\\\n\\gamma_{B} &= -1.\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe mediation effect for group A is \\(\\beta_{1A}\\gamma_A = 4\\) and for group B it is \\(\\beta_{1B}\\gamma_B = 3\\). So the average of the two (given equal group proportion) is \\(\\frac{4+3}{2} = 3.5\\).\nHowever, the conventional estimate will not give \\(3.5\\). This is because \\[\n\\bar{\\beta_i} = \\frac{\\beta_{1A}+\\beta_{1B}}{2} = \\frac{2 - 3}{2} = -0.5\n\\] and \\[\n\\bar{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\gamma_{A}+\\gamma_{B}}{2} = \\frac{2-1}{2} = 0.5\n\\] The conventional estimate from a product of coefficients is \\(-0.25\\) (\\(\\neq3.5\\)). This resembles basic probability, where \\[\n\\E\\big[\\beta_{1i}\\big]\\E\\big[\\gamma_i\\big] = \\E\\big[\\beta_{1i} \\gamma_i\\big] - \\underbrace{cov(\\beta_{1i}, \\gamma_i)}_{\\neq 0}\n\\] so the product of the averages does not equal the average of the product unless that additional covariance term is zero. So even if \\(M\\) has been randomized, we still cannot identify the AITE (mediation effect) if heterogeneities exist (Bullock, Green, and Ha 2010).\n\n\n\n\n\nMediation with moderation: Direct effect\nWith moderation (as specified in Equation 17), and from the definition of the ADTE (\\(\\zeta(1)\\) from Equation 4):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&ADTE \\equiv \\zeta(1) \\\\\n&=\\E\\big[Y_i(1,M_i(0))\\big] - \\E\\big[Y_i(0,M_i(0))\\big] \\\\\n&=\\Big\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2(\\E[M|T=0]) +\\beta_3 (\\E[M|T=0]) \\Big\\}\n  - \\Big\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_2(\\E[M|T=0])  \\Big\\}\\\\\n&= \\beta_1 + \\alpha_0\\beta_3.\n\\end{align}\\]\nSo the ADTE is the effect of \\(T\\) on \\(Y\\) and an additional effect that is the product of a constant for \\(M\\) and its effect moderated with \\(T\\). If no moderation exists (i.e., \\(\\beta_3=0\\)), the above reduces to just \\(\\beta_1\\), as in Section 14.2. In other words, mediation with moderation (allowing for the interaction of the mediator and treatment status) is the general case. No interactions is the special case."
