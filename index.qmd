## Statement of need
Mediation analysis apparently is not new [@Judd1981-rn]. 
But it is to me.
Mediation analysis aims to shed light on mechanisms between some exposure of interest and some outcome of interest.
Funding agencies (e.g., National Institute of Mental Health, NIH) for research grants even encourage or require mediation analyses of interventions to understand mechanisms [@Nguyen2021-oj].
"Mediation analyses" is also increasingly popular.
**FIGURE** should sum up this statement of need. 

Since results from mediation analysis may influence policy and practice, I thought I should at least gain some scientific literacy on it.
Here's my dive into mediation analysis.
Buckle up.

<!-- Some notes on treatment effects -->
## (Un-mediated) Treatment effects {#sec-un-mediated-treatment-effects}
First, to set some context with the causal inference approach with (model-free) potential outcomes (`PO`) without mediation. 
In a simple setup with just treatment $T$ and an outcome of interes $Y$ (without the mediator $M$ for now), the main estimand of interest is the average treatment effect (`ATE`) defined as 
$$
\tau \equiv \E\big[Y(1)\big] - \E\big[Y(0)\big],
$${#eq-ate}

for the simplest scenario where $T$ is a binary split:
$$ 
T = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if treated}, \\
0 & \text{if untreated},
\end{cases}
$$

and where $Y(1)$ is the potential outcome with treatment ($T=1$) and $Y(0)$ is the potential outcome without treatment ($T=0$).
For a given individual, only $Y(1)$ is observed with treatment.
 $Y(0)$ is the counterfactual.[^2]

[^2]: Aka missing data as the ''Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference'' [@Holland1986-yr].


```{dot}

}
```
  <!-- d -> Y [ style=invis, label="", shape=plaintext] -->

In reality, all we observe are outcomes conditional on the treatment $[Y|T=t]$ and the *statistical solution* [@Holland1986-yr] is via differences in averages
$$
\E\big[Y \big|T=1\big] - \E\big[Y\big|T=0\big]
$$

which reduces to @eq-ate under certain conditions such as the `independence assumption`:[^3]

$$
Y_i(t)  \ind T_i.
$${#eq-independence-assumption}

[^3]: The conditional analog is similar for some baseline set of observables $\textbf{X}$: $\big[Y_i(t) \ind T_i\big] \Big| \textbf{X}_i$ [e.g., @Imbens2004-tp; @Angrist2009-oz]. *This vignette will largely abstract away from $\textbf{X}$ for simplicity.*
  
The simplest way to estimate $\tau$, given the assumptions are met, is 
$$
Y_i = \alpha + \tau T_i + \varepsilon_i.
$$
  

<!-- Mediation through the lens of potential outcomes -->
## Mediation through the lens of potential outcomes

[^temporal-order]: Separate issue of temporal ordering of T, M, and Y (not covered in this vignette. See P49 of Stuart et al 2021 for more references.)

[^4]: The total effect (TE) is apparently used in place of the ATE in the language of mediation analysis [e.g., @Judd1981-rn; @Robins1992-ty; @Imai2010-fu; @Bullock2010-vb; @Nguyen2021-oj; @whatif].

[^cam-notation]: This PO notation is similar to that in @Imbens2004-tp, @Angrist2009-oz, @Imai2010-tg; @Nguyen2021-oj, etc. @Pearl2001-ct, @whatif, etc., have slightly different PO notations.

I was wondering how mediation analysis fit into this barebones potential outcomes framework.
Most publications with mediation analysis are in the tradition of the Baron and Kenny tradition [@Judd1981-rn; @Baron1986-zn; @MacKinnon2012-jl] (hereafter the classical mediation approach).
Inherent in mediation analysis, whether made explicit or not, is a causal hypothesis [@Nguyen2021-oj].
T causes Y through M.
There is, however, nothing in the mechanics of the classical approach that guarantees that uni-direction.[^mediation-wo-causation]

[^mediation-wo-causation]: A "mediation analysis" without this explicit path (partly implied by the temporal ordering) is really just a "third variable analysis" which is an analysis of association [@Nguyen2021-oj].

[^mediation-causal]: This is different from other regular regression analyses, where, depending on the target and asssumptions, both causal and conditional association interpretations are valid [@Nguyen2021-oj].

So mediation could benefit from, or deserves, explicit causal thinking [@Nguyen2021-oj].[^mediation-causal]
Work to think of mediation in the causal inference framework started as early as @Robins1992-ty and as recent (at time of writing) as @Stuart2022-bm (here after the causal inference approach).[^temporal-order]
With a proposed mediation path through a variable $M$, the analog of the `ATE` (from @eq-ate) is now: [^cam-notation]

$$
\tau = \E\big[Y\left(1, M(1)\right)\big] - \E\big[Y(0, M(0))\big],
$${#eq-ate2}
where (like $T$) the simplest scenario is:
$$ 
M = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if T = 1}, \\
0 & \text{if T = 0},
\end{cases}
$$
where the value of the mediator $M$ also depends on $T$.

```{dot}
//| fig-cap: "Graph of mediation analysis. The path between T and Y is the direct effect (@eq-direct-estimand). The mediation effect is captured from $T$ to $M$ and then $M$ to $Y$ (@eq-indirect-estimand)."

digraph Mediation {
  rankdir=LR ;
  splines=false;
  layout=dot;
  node [shape=circle,fontsize="10"]
  M -> Y [arrowsize=0.35];
  T -> Y [arrowsize=0.35];

```
[^5]: While going through a bunch of resources different fields, I came across a suggestion that the direct effect should really be called the unmediated effect (although I was unable to trace back the source). The notion is that the *direct effect* is no more a direct effect than the residual is a guassian error.
If there are unspecified mediation pathway(s), the direct effect will subsume those.

From the total effect (@eq-ate2),[^4] we can start decomposing into the direct and indirect effects.[^5]
Apparently there are two different sets of estimands [@Nguyen2021-oj]. (No one told me that...)

The direct effect is:
$$
\zeta(t) \equiv \E\big[Y_i(1, M_i(t))\big] - \E\big[Y_i(0, M_i(t))\big], \qquad t \in \{0, 1\}.
$${#eq-direct-estimand}

The indirect effect is:
$$
\delta(t) \equiv \E\big[Y_i(t, M_i(1))\big] - \E\big[Y_i(t, M_i(0))\big], \qquad t \in \{0, 1\}.
$${#eq-indirect-estimand}

Varying $t$ gives two different sets of estimands for each of $\delta$ and $\zeta$.

<!-- Set A: ADTE and AITE -->
## Set A: ADTE and AITE
The first set of estimands for direct and indirect effects are the average direct treatment effect 
$$
ADTE \equiv \zeta(0) = \underbrace{\E\big[Y(1,M(0))\big] - \E\big[Y(0,M(0))\big]}_{\text{effect of $T$ on $Y$ when $M$ is held at M(T=0)}}
$${#eq-adte}
and the average indirect treatment effect.
$$
AITE \equiv \delta(1) = \underbrace{\E\big[Y(1,M(1))\big] - \E\big[Y(1,M(0))\big]}_{\text{effect of $M$ on $Y$ when $T=1$}}
$${#eq-aite}

The decomposition of the `ATE` into the two effects follows directly from the @eq-ate2:

:::{.column-page}

\begin{align}
\underbrace{\E\big[Y(1, M(1))\big] - \E\big[Y(0, M(0))\big]}_{\text{total effect}}
&= \E\big[Y(1, M(1))\big] \underbrace{- \E\big[Y(1,M(0))\big] + \E\big[Y(1,M(0))\big]}_{\text{additive identity}} - \E\big[Y(0, M(0))\big]\\
&= \underbrace{\E\big[Y(1, M(1))\big] - \E\big[Y(1,M(0))\big]}_{\text{AITE}} + \underbrace{\E\big[Y(1,M(0))\big] - \E\big[Y(0, M(0))\big]}_{\text{ADTE}}
\end{align}
::: 

[^6]: Sometimes `ACME` [average causal mediation effect, @Imai2010-fu; @Imai2010-tg]. ADTE is aka the natural direct effect (NDE). AITE is aka the natural indirect effect (NIE). That's Pearl's language [@Pearl2001-ct]. Another one is pure direct effect and total indirect effect [e.g., @Robins1992-ty; @whatif].

The `AITE` in particular is therefore also known as the causal mediation effect.[^6]
This decomposition is suitable when there are strong priors about a direct effect but unclear priors on whether an indirect effect also exists.
An example could be where $T$ is a STEM degree that raises labor market value $Y$ through some technical competency, but it is unclear whether additional benefits also arise through networking with peers $M$.

```
Another example could be where $T$ is a dietary program (e.g., a low-whatever-the-frack-is-the-new-fad diet) that lowers diabetic risk $Y$, but it is unclear if reduction in diabetic risk also comes from weight loss $M$. 
If not, targeting weight loss may be of limited efficacy.
This is of practical implication since it informs where and what type of intervention should occur.

<!-- Set B: ADTET and AITEC -->
## Set B: ADTET and AITEC
The second set of estimands that decompose the `ATE` are the average direct treatment effect wrt the treated

$$
ADTET \equiv \zeta(1) = \underbrace{\E\big[Y(1,M(1))\big] - \E\big[Y(0, M(1))\big]}_{\text{effect of T when $M$ is held at M(T=1)}}
$${#eq-adtet}

and the average indirect treatment effects wrt to controls
$$
AITEC \equiv \delta(0) = \underbrace{\E\big[Y(0,M(1))\big] - \E\big[Y(0, M(0))\big]}_{\text{effect of M when $T=0$}}.
$${#eq-aitec}

Decompositon again follows directly:

:::{.column-page}
$$
\underbrace{\E\big[Y(1, M(1))\big] - \E\big[Y(0, M(0))\big]}_{\text{total effect}}
= \underbrace{\E\big[Y(1,M(1))\big] - \E\big[Y(0, M(1))\big]}_{\text{ADTET}} + \underbrace{\E\big[Y(0,M(1))\big] - \E\big[Y(0, M(0))\big]}_{\text{AITEC}}.
$$
::: 

This decomposition is useful for when there are strong priors about an indirect mediating path, but unclear priors about a direct effect.
An example could be where $T$ is an MBA degree with weak connection labor market value $Y$ through some technical competency, but where benefits mainly arise through networking in the MBA program $M$.

<!-- Differences with traditional mediation analysis -->
## Classical mediation analysis {#sec-classical-ma}
In the classial mediation approach, in addition to

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta T_i + \varepsilon_i,
$$

two equations are estimated in a structural equation model[@Baron1986-zn]. 
One modelling T and its effect on M.
The other modelling the effect of T and M on Y.

$$
M_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 T_i + \varepsilon_{1i}
$${#eq-classical-med1}
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T_i + \beta_2 M_i + \varepsilon_{2i}
$${#eq-classical-med2}

@eq-classical-med1 and @eq-classical-med2 are estimated separately.
The mediation effect is observed via the "product-of-coefficients" method as ($\hat{\alpha_1} \hat{\beta_2}$)---quite literally the effect of $T$ on $M$ multiplied by the effect of $M$ on $Y$.
The direct effect of $T$ on $Y$ would be observed with $\hat{\beta_1}$.  

The conditional analog of this with a set of covariates $\textbf{X}$ should follow closely [@Judd1981-rn].

<!-- Common ground: Classical approach and causal inference approach -->
## Classical mediation analysis: Common grounds {#sec-classical-mediation}
How would the causal inference approach with potential outcomes connect to the classical approach?

The reduced form (from @eq-classical-med1 and @eq-classical-med2) is:
$$
\E\big[Y_i\big|T_i,M_i\big] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \E[T_i] + \beta_2 \E[M_i].
$${#eq-sem-rf}

Together with the definition of the `AITE` (@eq-aite), this gives
\begin{align}
AITE
&=\E\big[Y_i (1, M_i(1))\big] - \E\big[Y_i (1, M_i(0))\big] \\
&=\Big\{
  \beta_0 + \beta_1 (1) + \beta_2 (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 (1)
\Big\} - 
\Big\{
  \beta_0 + \beta_1 (1) + \beta_2 (\alpha_0)
\Big\}\\
&=\Big\{\alpha_0\beta_2 + \alpha_1\beta_2\Big\} - \Big\{\alpha_0\beta_2 \Big\}\\
&=\alpha_1 \beta_2
\end{align}
which is exactly the same mediation effect proposed by the "product-of-coefficients" from the structural equations above (@sec-classical-ma).[^note-si-classical-mediation]

[^note-si-classical-mediation]: @sec-si-classical-mediation in the [Supplementary appendix](#supplementary-appendix) shows that what falls out from the other three estimands is also consistent with the product of coefficients.

If the classical and causal inference approach both agree on the underlying intuition of mediation, why use potential outcomes?
One reason is it helps clarify what the identification assumptions are.

<!-- Biases, bounds, and assumptions -->
## Biases, bounds, and assumptions {#sec-bias-bounds-assumptions}
What we only observe in the real world is $[Y_i \big|T = t, M = m]$, $t \in \{0, 1\}$, $m \in \{0, 1\}$.
We also only observe actualized potential outcomes $Y(t, m)$ for the corresponding $m$ and $t$ values.
From the `AITE` (@eq-aite), the observed differences in a mediated effect, given that treatment is "`switched on`"
 $t=1$, is   

:::{.column-page}
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\E\big[Y\big|T=1, M = 1\big] - \E\big[Y\big|T=1, M=0\big] \\
&=\E\big[Y(1,1)\big|T=1, M=1\big] - \E\big[Y(1,0)\big|T=1, M=0\big] \\
&=\E\big[Y(1,1)\big|M=1\big] - \E\big[Y(1,0)\big|M=0\big]  \qquad\qquad (\text{from }Y_i(t,m) \ind T_i)
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-med-selection-bias0}
:::

where, even given randomization of $T$ (analagous to @eq-independence-assumption in the un-mediated case), the selection issue with $M$ persists. 
It will carry its own selection bias unless additional assumptions are imposed.
The above only reduces to the `AITE` by imposing additional assumption on the statistical independence of $M$,

:::{.column-page}

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\E\big[Y(1,1)\big|M=1\big] - \E\big[Y(1,0)\big|M=0\big]\\
&= \E\big[Y(1,1)\big|M=1\big] - \underbrace{\E\big[Y(1, 0)\big|M=1\big] + \E\big[Y(1, 0)\big|M=1\big]}_{\text{additive identity}} - \E\big[Y(1,0)\big|M=0\big]  \\
&=\underbrace{\E\big[Y(1,1) - Y(1, 0)\Big|M=1\big]}_{\text{analog to AITE}} + \underbrace{\E\big[Y(1, 0)\big|M=1\big] - \E\big[Y(1,0)\big|M=0\big]}_{\text{selection into M}} 
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-med-selection-bias}
:::

where $E[Y(1, 0)|M=1]$ in the first equality is a counterfactual---what would potential outcome be for people with the $M$ `switched off` $m=0$ given that it is actually `switched on` $m=1$ (*concrete example* later below).
The second equality collects terms into the underlying mediation estimand and an **additional bias component**.[^bias-algebra]

[^bias-algebra]: @sec-bias-bounds-assumptions-algebra in the [Supplementary appendix](#supplementary-appendix) offer an alternative algebraic insight of the bias.

[^aite-bias-same-sign]: Or, generally, share the same sign as the AITE.

There is a tendency for this bias to be positive,[^aite-bias-same-sign] and, therefore overstate the mediation effect. 
Take as *concrete example*, a case where we are interested in child income $Y$, parent income $T$, and college attendance $M$ in a classic case of intergenerational income mobility. 
Parent income affects child income, but also potentially through access to better education.
The expected sign of the AITE should be positive.
The first part of the bias is the counterfactual of the potential income of the child of not going to college, given that she did.
Conditional on parent income, the child that goes to college should have qualities (non-existent in the child that never goes to college) that would be helpful for labor market success, and, to this extent, suggest that the bias component is $> 0$.
Hence, without intervenening on the assignment of $M$, the estimated mediation effect tends to be bias.
But the observed effect may still be useful to provide optimistic **bounds** for the underlying mediation effect.[^bounds]

[^bounds]: This *bound* is *not* a statistical property. Instead, the bound is based on counterfactual reasoning about what the plausible potential outcomes are from on domain understanding.

The last line in @eq-med-selection-bias only reduces to the true `AITE` by imposing additional **assumptions**.

$$
\Big\{ Y_i(t, m), M_i(t')\Big\} \ind T_i
$${#eq-seq-ignorability1}
$$
\big[Y_i(t', m) \ind M_i(t)\big] \Big| T_i = t
$${#eq-seq-ignorability2}

[^heterogeneities]: @sec-heterogeneities in the [Supplementary appendix](#supplementary-appendix) shows an example of how the AITE cannot be identified even with randomization if heterogeneities in effects exist.

First, for a causal interpretation, the treatment assignment $T$ has to be statistically orthogonal to the potential outcomes and the potential mediators.
This should usually be satisfied with randomization of $T$ as in the usual unmediated case (@sec-un-mediated-treatment-effects).
This assumption was imposed in the last equality of @eq-med-selection-bias0.
Second, given the actual value $T_i = t$, the mediator $M$ should be statistically orthogonal to the potential outcome.
The standard proposed solution to achieve this is to subject $M$ to experimental manipulation, just as with $T$.[^heterogeneities]
The above is the `sequential ignorability assumption` since the assumptions are made *sequentially* [@Imai2010-fu]. 

In addition, there is an (slighly more subtle) assumption with the common data support $T$ (and $M$).
$$
\exists \theta > 0: \ \theta \leq \E \left[ T_i = t \right] \leq (1-\theta), \qquad t \in \{0, 1\}
$$
With an additional modeling of mediation, an additional assumption applies to the mediator:
$$
\exists \eta > 0: \ \eta \leq \E \left[ M_i = m \big| T_i = t \right] \leq (1-\eta), \qquad t \in \{0, 1\}.
$$

Loosely speaking, with mediation, twice the identification assumptions are needed.

<!-- Mediation and instrumental variables -->

}
```

What if one thinks that the effect of $T$ should only pass purely through $M$?
In this case, the graph in @fig-mediation reduces to @fig-IV.
This turns out to be the causal graph of the instrumental variables approach.
However, the catch now is that the set of identification assumption changes, with the sequential ignorability (@eq-seq-ignorability1, @eq-seq-ignorability2) no longer relevant [@Imai2010-fu].
Instead, the identification assumptions are those canonically established in the instrumental variable framework, such as that of exclusion restriction [@Angrist1996-gx].
Moreover, the instrumental variable framework, by design, a priori rule out other causal mechanisms which may be less than idea for many health and social science research [@Imai2010-fu].

<!-- Mediation with moderation -->
## Mediation with moderation
Mediation is not moderation.
Mediation allows the treatment $T$ to indirectly affect the outcome of interest $Y$ through some proposed mediator $M$.
Moderation, on the other hand, allows for the effect of $T$ to differ by levels of the moderator (e.g., vaccine efficacy differing by age groups).[^temporality] 
But it turns out the mediation analysis framework also supports moderation with an addition moderating term $(M_i \times T_i)$ in @eq-classical-med2.

[^temporality]: In terms of temporal ordering, moderators should be pre-exposure baselines (related to colliders/bad controls not covered here), while mediators should be post-exposure. Analyses termed as "mediation analyses", but where it is impossible for $T$ to influence $M$ because of temporal ordering, are really "third variable analyses" [@Nguyen2021-oj]. @sec-trends show a slight trend in "causal mediation analysis" only very recentlyss.

\begin{align}
M_i &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 T_i + \varepsilon_{1i}\\
Y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 T_i + \beta_2 M_i + \beta_3 M_i T_i + \varepsilon_{2i}
\end{align}
{#eq-mediator-moderator}

Again, using the definition of the `AITE` (@eq-aite)
\begin{align}
&AITE \equiv \delta(1) \\
&=\E\big[Y_i(1,M_i(1))\big] - \E\big[Y_i(1,M_i(0))\big] \\
&=\Big\{\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1) +\beta_3 (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1) \Big\}
  - \Big\{\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2(\alpha_0) + \beta_3 (\alpha_0) \Big\}\\
&=\beta_2 \alpha_1 + \beta_3 \alpha_1\\
&=\alpha_1(\beta_2 + \beta_3)
\end{align}

which is just the effect of $T$ on $M$ (the $\alpha_1$) multiplied by the coefficients of $M$ in the outcome regression ($\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$).

So the mediation framework also directly allows for the mediator to have a role as a moderator.
Compared to just $\alpha_1\beta_2$ from @sec-classical-mediation, the additional $\alpha_1\beta_3$ captures the additional effect, if any, of the mediator $M$ for those individuals in the treatment group $T=1$.
$\alpha_1\beta_3$ is also another way of describing how $M$ moderates the effect of the treatment $T$.
If it turns out $\beta_3 = 0$, then this implies no moderating relationship exist and the model reverts to that in @eq-classical-med2.

## Endnote
This vignette is merely my attempt at gaining some literacy on (causal) mediation analysis.
A lot of studies I've seen implicity use mediation to directly imply some kind of directional effect.
This clearly alludes to a causal channel, but without being clear on what the estimands are or what identification assumptions are needed.
This tracks with the exegesis by @Bullock2010-vb and @Nguyen2021-oj.
No new grounds have been broken by me here. 
This is just my attempt at parsing and then synthesizing different resources that already exist (some as early as @Stuart2022-bm in the [Journal of Causal Inference](https://www.degruyter.com/journal/key/jci/html){target="_blank"}.
Also, not everything is covered here, but the list of canonical resources should lead to more details.

<!-- Classical mediation analysis: ADTE, ADTET, AITEC -->
### Classical mediation analysis: ADTE, ADTET, AITEC {#sec-si-classical-mediation}
Together with the definition of the ADTE (@eq-aite), this gives
\begin{align}
ADTE = \zeta(0)  
&=\E\big[Y_i (1, M_i(0))\big] - \E\big[Y_i (0, M_i(0))\big] \\
&=\Big\{
  \beta_0 + \beta_1 (1) + \beta_2 (\alpha_0) 
\Big\} -   
\Big\{
  \beta_0 + \beta_1 (0) + \beta_2 (\alpha_0)
\Big\}\\
&=\beta_1,
\end{align}
which is exactly the same $\beta_1$ coefficient in @eq-classical-med2 capturing the direct effect of $T$ on $Y$.

If the M is `switched on` $m=1$, we get the same result for ADTET (@eq-adtet):
\begin{align}
ADTET = \zeta(1)  
&=\E\big[Y_i (1, M_i(1))\big] - \E\big[Y_i (0, M_i(1))\big] \\
&=\Big\{
  \beta_0 + \beta_1 (1) + \beta_2 (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 (1)
\Big\} - 
\Big\{
  \beta_0 + \beta_1 (0) + \beta_2 (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 (1))
\Big\}\\
&=\beta_1.
\end{align}

The AITEC [@eq-aitec] also reduces to the product-of-coefficients $\alpha_1 \beta_2$:

\begin{align}
AITEC = \delta(0)
&=\E\big[Y_i (0, M_i(1))\big] - \E\big[Y_i (0, M_i(0))\big] \\
&=\Big\{
  \beta_0 + \beta_1 (0) + \beta_2 (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 (1)
\Big\} - 
\Big\{
  \beta_0 + \beta_1 (0) + \beta_2 (\alpha_0)
\Big\}\\
&=\alpha_1 \beta_2.
\end{align}

### Biases, bounds, and assumptions: Algebraic version {#sec-bias-bounds-assumptions-algebra}

@Bullock2010-vb offer algebraic perspective of the bias seen in @sec-bias-bounds-assumptions.
Starting with the linear structural equation model:
\begin{align}
Y_i &= \alpha_1 + \beta_1 T_i + \varepsilon_{1i}\\
M_i &= \alpha_2 + \beta_2 T_i + \varepsilon_{2i}\\
Y_i &= \alpha_3 + \beta_3 T_i + \gamma M_i + \varepsilon_{3i}\\
\end{align}

The probability limit of the estimated mediated effect $\hat{\gamma}$ [@Bullock2010-vb] is 
$$
\underbrace{\gamma}_{\text{AITE}} + \underbrace{\frac{cov(\varepsilon_{2i}, \varepsilon_{3i})}{var(\varepsilon_{2i})}}_{\text{asymptotic bias}},
$$
where $cov(\varepsilon_{2i}, \varepsilon_{3i})$ is the covariance of the error terms in the un-mediated model and the mediated model.
So $\hat{\gamma}$ is only consistent if the covariance term reduces to 0, which is unlikely because whatever unmeasured $X_i$ is in $\varepsilon_{2i}$ should also be present in $\varepsilon_{3i}$ (like unmeasured qualities of a good worker in @sec-bias-bounds-assumptions).
Moreover, the sign of $cov(\varepsilon_{2i}, \varepsilon_{3i})$ tend to coincide with the sign of $\gamma$, leading to the overstatement of the magnitude of the mediation effect $\gamma$, if any (as discussed in @sec-bias-bounds-assumptions).

### Heterogeneities in mediation effect {#sec-heterogeneities}

Not as much is said about heterogeneities in mediation effect it seems.
@Bullock2010-vb does a treatment of this.
Apparently, heterogeneities together with the product-of-coefficients method can be problematic, even when $M$ is already subject to experimental intervention.

A similar model to @eq-classical-med1 and @eq-classical-med2 with heterogeneities in effect is
\begin{align}
M_i &= \alpha_1 + \beta_{1i} T_i + \varepsilon_{1i}\\
Y_i &= \alpha_2 + \beta_{2i} T_i + \gamma_{i} M_i + \varepsilon_{2i}
\end{align}

  T -> Y [arrowsize=0.35, label="(direct effect)"];
  T -> M [arrowsize=0.35, label="2"];
}
```

```{dot}
//| fig-cap: "Group B's indirect effect is $3 (= (-3)(-1))$. The effect from $T$ to $M$ is -3, and the effect from $M$ to $Y$ is -1. Abstracting away from direct effects."
//| label: fig-heterogeneities-B
//| fig-width: 300px
//| fig-height: 100px
//| column: margin

digraph Mediation {
  rankdir=LR ;
  splines=false;
  layout=dot;
  node [shape=circle,]
  M -> Y [arrowsize=0.35, label="-1"];
  T -> Y [arrowsize=0.35, label="(direct effect)"];
  T -> M [arrowsize=0.35, label=" -3"];
}
```
To see why heterogeneity could be bad without simulations, suppose we know that the true effects for two groups, A and B (equal proportions), are as follow:
\begin{align}
\beta_{1A} &= 2\\
\gamma_{A} &= 2
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}
\beta_{1B} &= -3\\
\gamma_{B} &= -1.
\end{align}

The mediation effect for group A is $\beta_{1A}\gamma_A = 4$ and for group B it is $\beta_{1B}\gamma_B = 3$.
So the average of the two (given equal group proportion) is $\frac{4+3}{2} = 3.5$.

But conventional estimate will not give $3.5$.
This is because
$$
\bar{\beta_i} = \frac{\beta_{1A}+\beta_{1B}}{2} = \frac{2 - 3}{2} = -0.5
$$ 
and
$$
\bar{\gamma} = \frac{\gamma_{A}+\gamma_{B}}{2} = \frac{2-1}{2} = 0.5
$$ 
The conventional estimate from product of coefficients is $-0.25$ ($\neq3.5$).
This resembles basic probability where

$$
\E\big[\beta_{1i}\big]\E\big[\gamma_i\big] = \E\big[\beta_{1i} \gamma_i\big] - \underbrace{cov(\beta_{1i}, \gamma_i)}_{\neq 0}
$$
so the product of the averages do not equal the average of the product unless that additional covariance term is zero.
So even if $M$ has been randomized, we still cannot identify the AITE (mediation effect) if heterogeneities exist [@Bullock2010-vb].
